| Repo                             | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [NLP Sentiment Analysis][eee]    | Explored sentiment analysis techniques using Natural Language Processing, experimenting with a custom-designed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network to interpret emotional nuances in text.|
| [Algae Classification][aaa]      | Utilized Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNN) to identify algae blooms in water bodies, contributing to environmental monitoring efforts through the application of computer vision principles.                                  |
| [Flower Classification][bxs]           | Developed a Convolutional Deep Learning Network to classify flowers based on visual characteristics, aiming to contribute modestly to automated botanical identification processes.                   |
| [Recommendation System][kag]     | Implemented collaborative filtering techniques within an Item-Based recommendation system, integrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and explanatory analysis. Additionally, I built and deployed a machine learning model for prediction, aiming to contribute towards enhancing user experience through personalized recommendations.|
| [LLM Summarizer][aol]            | Leveraging chatgpt prompting for doing technical summaries of news articles web scraped from various news sites where the goal was to make them be explained in more Technical Depth or in a Non technical way, these are sent to Discord automatic via Airflow as notifications and displayed on a dashboard |
| [Disease Prediction][aob]        | Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on medical datasets, leveraging machine learning algorithms to engage in predictive modeling for disease detection.                                 |
| [Statistical Methods][cd]        | Worked with "Iris" Dataset for statistical analysis, encompassing hypothesis testing and regression modeling, to extract insights from data patterns.                                    |
| [Data analysis (Covid-19)][ml]   | Investigated and created dashboard of Covid-19 Outbreak                |
| [Data analysis (Olympics)][pe]   |  Investigated historical Olympic data creating interactive dashboards to visualize trends and athlete achievements, presenting the findings.                                                   |
| [Python Classifier][gc]          | Pichu or Pikachu classifier with k-nearest neighbor.                                            |
| [Geometry Shapes Class][aoc]     | Implemented OOP to create geometric objects.                                                    |
